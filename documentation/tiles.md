### Topic
Topic: What the tile is about. The bottom label.

Upon tile creation the label is selected for ease of replacing.

While parts of the label may overflow the textarea limits, the entire label can be viewed by hovering over it.

### Producers

Producers: What/who produces the emotion. The label for each side.

When creating a new tile, the tile will inherit its producer labels from the previous tile in the grid.

Users can edit the producers for each tile.

Tiles only display the first two letters of each producer. Hovering over a producer label will display the entire label in a tooltip.


### Tags
Tags correspond to tabs within the user interface. A given tile will appear in the tabs specified by its tags.

Deleting a tile from one tab removes the corresponding tag. As long as the tile still has at least one tag,it will still be visible in that tab.

Removing all tags from a tile places it in the graveyard. If deleted from the graveyard it will be permanently deleted.
