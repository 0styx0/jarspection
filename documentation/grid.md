### Adding new tiles

Adding a tile can be done in two ways:
- By clicking the outlined '+' sign at the end of the grid
- By using the keyboard shortcut Meta+N

#### New tile location

If you type the keyboard shortcut while a tile is already selected (eg, you're typing a label), then the new tile will appear after the currently focused tile.

If nothing is focused, or you add the tile via the '+' button, the tile will appear at the end of the grid.

### Removing tiles

Removing a tile can be done in two ways:
- By clicking the 'x' at the top of the tile
- By using the keyboard shortcut Meta+W

After deleting via the shortcut, focus will revert to the previous tile in the grid.
