### About

Each jar represents a preference. Fill up the jar with a color representing your preference. The amount you fill it represents how strongly you feel about that preference.

This tool generally suits the following overarching categories:
- Choices
- Communication
- Reflection

Within each category, it suits the following overarching usecases:
- Introspection
- Communication

For example, I loved watching _I Saw The TV Glow_. If I were reflecting on different movies that I've watched, I'd fill it most of the way with green. I had a more neutral opinion about _Children of Men_ so I'd fill it halfway with yellow. If I wanted to gain more insight into a friend or partner, I'd then ask them to fill in the other half.

### How to use

Customize jar halves for your usecase:
- Giving/receiving: Find your comfort levels. Do you enjoy giving words of affirmation more than receiving them?
- Person A/Person B: Match your preferences
- Past/Future: What you've thought in the past vs what you feel now
  - Bonus: You can export your current jars and look back on them later

Examples of categories you can use this tool for:
- Love languages
- Movie/book/song opinions
- Food preferences
- Vacation plans
- Chore likes/dislikes

And anything else that you want to introspect/communicate about.
